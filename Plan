After talking to sir, here is what I have realised.

Report will be the first thing the TA looks at, it's kinda like a formal observations.txt. So we need to explain in brief whatever code + graphs we have submitted alongwith the answers obtained inside the report.

Basically report is for making the job of the TA easier.

Maintaining an overleaf doc for the report
https://www.overleaf.com/project/61209229c59bc27444859339

Plan here-

Shashwat Leads- Q 1, 2, 4

Q1

i) Code + Graph

Everything above explained in the report
